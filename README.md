## Final Note

This project has been swinging around inside my PC since Apex Legends SS10 was released, and I was creating it for fun, only using it for a while. So I released it in case someone wanted this.

**Competitive, Arena, Ranked Arena is currently partially supported (I only play public: TRIO). Any PR, Contribution is appreciated.**
